Tech Stack used is:
Python, Streamlit

Hugging Face Transformers (distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english, gpt2)

Torch
How:
Sentiment detection using a pre-trained BERT model

Text generation aligned with detected sentiment

Simple Streamlit interface for input/output
Model is been deployed on streamlit and live right now can be use.
